                <p>My name is Oscar Flores. I was born and raised in San Diego California, and I am a future web
                 developer who is trying to get his foot in the door of this very complex yet amazing industry. 
                 I am currently attending a full stack bootcamp provided by UCSD extension out of my hometown 
                 San Diego. Prior to starting this coding bootcamp I was attending Southwestern College with the 
                 plan being to get an associates for transfer with my major being computer science. That turned 
                 out to be pretty tedious, and got boring quite quickly which is when I started to look for other 
                 options and came across this program. My love for computers and technology in general came about 
                 fairly young, but it wasn’t until highschool that I started to get serious about wanting to 
                 make a career out of programming. This course has taught me various skills that I believe I can 
                 implement at a high level in a work environment like HTML, CSS,and JavaScript. I’m sure this small 
                 sample of my work will demonstrate the understanding and skill that you are looking for in a 
                 future employee. Thank you.
