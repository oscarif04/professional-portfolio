# professional-portfolio

This website serves a my personal portfolio where I can showcase some of my work that I've done over the last couple months.
Within this website I have an "about me" section which gives a brief background about muself, a "work" section where my past 
projects and homeworks are linked which makes it easier to see the applications live, and lastly a "contact" section
where I list my phone number, email, as well as my LinkedIn and Github accounts.
